to do:
- edit credits
- add empty stratagem and equipment borders so the page doesnt look so empty when the page loads


feature ideas:
- add DDR codes to stratagems
- cleanup borders on some images
- save options in local storage
- add armor randomizer
- when a stratagem or equipment is clicked, a modal opens up with tips for that item
- add the following randomizer options.
  - all/no/default orbitals
  - all/no/default eagles
  - all/no/default defensive
- add separate page for weapons/stratagem list with the modals for each one
- add page for enemies with tips for each one?

bugs:
- emancipator exosuit needs image
- when no booster is able to be given (no warbonds selected), booster column looks bad
