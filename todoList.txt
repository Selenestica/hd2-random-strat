to do:
- add empty stratagem and equipment borders so the page doesnt look so empty when the page loads

feature ideas:
- save options in local storage
- add link to buymeacoffee
- buy nvigneux a coffee
- enemy randomizer
- difficulty randomizer
- button to randomize everything at once
- add link to low sodium Helldivers discord
- holding click on stratagem or equipment icon will change it
- add armor randomizer with armor images instead of armor passives randomizer

bugs:
- when no booster is able to be given (no warbonds selected), booster column looks bad
- add image for link preview
