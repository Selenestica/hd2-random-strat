Budget Blitz
- BUGS:
  - mysterious issue equipped purchased items not always decreasing in quantity when mission complete

- remove credit cap (sorry Akima this was pretty unpopular xD but we tried!)
- save equipped items when going to shop and coming back
- always show Purchased Items and Default Items (remove ablity to collapse those sections)
- update wording from "Select Stratagem Below" to "Click on Stratagem Below"
- change credits earned from mission time remaining from (% remaining * 0.25) to (minutes remaining * 0.60)
  - the mission timer is more obvious and stays on the screen longer than the % remaining number
- ability to rename mission saves
- ending score based on total credits earned (credits saved or spent does not matter, only total earned)
- filter by price (amount of credits) in Shop
- toast notification when purchasing item "Quasar Cannon sent to inventory"
- in loadout view, button to re-arrange purchased items and default items so theyre not a mess 
- can purchase a completely random item for 5 credits (similar to CoD Zombies)
  - price goes up by 5 each time you buy
  - will not affect the future price of the rolled item
- consider reducing cost of secondaries and armor passives
- ability to download PDF after challenge complete

- create key in save data that tracks credits earned per mission in an array of objects
  - score based on total credits earned (credits saved or spent does not matter, only total earned)
  -  if mission failed, credits earned from repeated missions dont count toward the total 
    - probably check the length of the array each time. if missionCounter - 7 is greater than length of array, add the data. else dont add data.
