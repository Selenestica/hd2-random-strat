to do:
- add empty stratagem and equipment borders so the page doesnt look so empty when the page loads
- add images for new equipment
  - Urban Legends and Stun Baton
	- Killzone collab equipment
	- FRV
- when no booster is able to be given (no warbonds selected), booster column looks bad
- armor randomizer option for armor set
- add armor image row above equipment row
- add images for armor passives, sets, and sizes

feature ideas:

- buy nvigneux a coffee
- enemy randomizer
- difficulty randomizer
- button to randomize everything at once
- add link to low sodium Helldivers discord
