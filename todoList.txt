Budget Blitz
- earn money (SC, medals, or req. slips) for completing missions. More stars = more money
  - credits earned per star is static, so earlier difficulties with lower max star potential will earn the least
- earn extra money by collecting SUPER SAMPLES and HIGH-VALUE ITEMS (bug egg or bot head)
- spend money at the shop to purchase items (strats, armor, throwables, primary, secondary, boosters)
  - or choose to save your money
- you buy items for a set amount of missions. So basically, items are consumables
  - number of uses starts at 1 mission for X credits, 2 missions for X*2+Y credits, 3 missions for X*2+Y*2, X*3+Y*3 and so on
    - so buying an item for more than one mission becomes increasingly more expensive the amount of missions you add
  - items types with smaller pools can be used for 3(?) missions by default (secondary, armor passive, throwables)
  - can purchase from a RANDOM LOOT box for a low price (similar to COD Zombies). Default mission usage for random item is 3 missions.
  - every operation (mission?) the price of items will change based on a random variance value in addition to their standard price
    - i.e. a Quasar cannon will cost X+(randomNumber) on Diff 5, and Diff 6 will cost X+(differentRandomNumber).
      - random number will be -(X) to X. So the randomness can make the item cheaper or more expensive
  - every operation (mission?) a small amount of items will be on sale (maybe a random number between 2 - 5 items)
    - items on sale will be 50% off
- TBD, the amount of credits earned for stars
- TBD, which difficulty to start on...
  - maybe start difficulty 5, with a certain amount of credits to make purchases
- starter items can always be used (probably same items as Penitent Crusade)
- GOAL: Complete an operation on Super Helldive difficulty
  - SUB-OBJECTIVE: the more money you have at the end of a run, the higher your score
