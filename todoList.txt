to do:
- add empty stratagem and equipment borders so the page doesnt look so empty when the page loads

feature ideas:
- add DDR codes to stratagems
- cleanup borders on some images
- save options in local storage
- add armor randomizer
- when a stratagem or equipment is clicked, a modal opens up with tips for that item
- add separate page for weapons/stratagem list with the modals for each one
- add page for enemies with tips for each one?

bugs:
- when no booster is able to be given (no warbonds selected), booster column looks bad
- clean up images for weapons
- add image for link preview
